# Gallery Carousel Debug & Fix Report

**Project:** BOB Home Care Website  
**Date:** November 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND VERIFIED

---

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Indicators Container ID Mismatch
**Problem:** JavaScript was looking for `getElementById('indicators')` but HTML had `id="carouselIndicators"`

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated JavaScript to use correct ID: `getElementById('carouselIndicators')`
- Location: `script.js` line 439

**Before:**
```javascript
this.indicatorsContainer = document.getElementById('indicators');
```

**After:**
```javascript
this.indicatorsContainer = document.getElementById('carouselIndicators');
```

---

### Issue 2: Duplicate Indicator Buttons
**Problem:** HTML had manually created 20 indicator buttons with `onclick="currentSlide()"` function that didn't exist, causing conflicts with dynamically generated indicators

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed all manual indicator buttons from HTML
- Let JavaScript create indicators dynamically
- Location: `index.html` lines 519-540

**Before:**
```html
<div class="carousel-indicators" id="carouselIndicators">
    <button class="indicator active" onclick="currentSlide(0)"></button>
    <button class="indicator" onclick="currentSlide(1)"></button>
    <!-- ... 18 more buttons ... -->
</div>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="carousel-indicators" id="carouselIndicators">
    <!-- Indicators will be dynamically generated by JavaScript -->
</div>
```
